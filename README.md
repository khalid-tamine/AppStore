Once you click on the recipe it takes you the details page where you can place your order by selecting one or more recipe , and
of course while you are navigating everything you select will be saved thanks to redux store, so that when you are done you check what
you have selected and confirm your order . When you confirm your order it is recorded in Firebse using firestore.
